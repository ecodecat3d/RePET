# RePET

RePET is a groundbreaking system designed for 3D printing using plastic bottles as raw material. The key to this system lies in the combination of various components that collaborate in transforming plastic bottles into filament suitable for 3D printing. Firstly, a heating block capable of reaching 200 degrees Celsius is complemented by a 1.6mm nozzle, playing an essential role in allowing controlled filament output.

The process begins with the preparation of plastic bottles, which are cut into strips using a specialized bottle cutter. These strips are then joined to form a larger coil, ensuring a continuous supply during printing and avoiding interruptions each time a bottle strip is depleted. During the printing process, the coil passes through the heating block, where the application of heat causes the deformation of the strips, generating the required 1.75mm filament.

The final stage of the process involves the entry of the deformed filament into the 3D printer's extruder. At this point, the printer's motor takes on the responsibility of generating the necessary force to extrude the filament in a controlled manner. This approach not only stands out for its technical innovation but also promotes sustainability by reusing materials, contributing to the reduction of plastic waste, and providing a creative and eco-friendly solution for 3D printing manufacturing.

### Atention!
This system has been implemented for Mingda printers. You can use the discount code 'ecodecat3d' for a €50 discount on your printers (Link to their website: https://3dmingdaofficial.com/es/collections/magician-series/products/magician-x2). If you wish to implement the system on your printer, you will need to edit the provided STEP files for your printer. Prior to implementation, ensure that the extruder can generate a minimum torque of 5kg*cm (equivalent to a Nema17 motor), operates at 24V, and is capable of printing at 255 degrees.
